OVERVIEW:
A mini-version of Dash, this application allows the user to display and work with several different medias in one
workspace. Users may select the first five buttons on the left to add a node of their choosing that can be resized
via the gray box in the top left of each node and moved around via the top dark green bar. Note that the nodes will
not move until they have been resized first. The bottom three buttons will display the added nodes in a horizontal 
line, delete a node, and link two nodes together accordingly. PLEASE make sure popups are not blocked as delete and
link display a message on a popup prompting for which node(s) the user would like to delete/link. The nodes are 
numbered in their title and these should be the numbers that are inputted into the prompts. Linking two nodes 
together will display a list at the bottom of each node with clickable text that will take the user to the corresponding
node.

DESIGN:
Each node extends their own interface that has the properties from NodeStore and NodeCollectionStore as they all are Nodes
and require access to the NodeCollectionStore while linking. NodeCollectionStore handles the actual functions that affect
all of the Nodes such as displaying the line view and linking. The FreeFormCanvas is the top level logic class because
it creates and renders all of the Nodes in the main screen and is the one calling the methods in NodeCollectionStore. Each
of the Nodes further have their own stores because they each store something unique from another, but still share core 
qualities such as x and y coordinates, hence all extending NodeStore.

KNOWN BUGS: 
The nodes will not move either by dragging the top bar or pressing "view as list" until they have been 
resized first. There is also the occasional issue where clicking the link to another node will not correctly transform
the canvas to display the connected node and will instead move elsewhere in the canvas.
